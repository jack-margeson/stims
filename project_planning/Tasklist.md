- [ ] Decide on object oriented language capable of interacting with database frameworks and also GUI creation
- [ ] Design user interface using sketches and prototyping
- [ ] Research database framework capable of handling schema with flexible types 
- [ ] Create development environment for whatever language/framework chosen
- [ ] Implement GUI from sketched designs, both user and administrator roles
- [ ] Make generic classes as templates for future items to be added 
- [ ] Provision space for database, test connectivity between programming language chosen and database
- [ ] Write member functions for template classes (add, remove, etc.)
- [ ] Link GUI elements to generic class member functions to test functionality 
- [ ] Research types of items that warehouses/libraries would benefit from keeping track of 
- [ ] Research libraries/methods for interpreting data from various scanners (barcode, NFC, RFID)
- [ ] Implement methods to handle data from multiple scanning interfaces
- [ ] Design classes that inherit the generic template class, incorporating scan data functions
- [ ] Refine GUI to reflect new functionality as well as refine visually
- [ ] Test program functionality (incl. scanning) in a mock real-world inventory scenario from the perspective of a database 
- [ ] Test program functionality (incl. scanning) in a mock real-world inventory scenario from the perspective of an End User
