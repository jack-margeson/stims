## List of major milestones
- Project framework/language researched and chosen 
- Interface design sketches complete
- GUI rough draft implemented 
- Database created and is able to be interfaced from code 
- Research on various tagging and scanning formats complete 
- Implementation of tagging and scanning methods complete 
- Designed and created class templates for common items
- Updated GUI with new features and visual refinement
- Tested program functionality from both user and administrator perspectives

## Timeline 

![Timeline Gantt chart](project_planning/project_gantt.png)

This timeline has been created under the assumption that the final date for senior design project submissions is 05/01/2023. The time to complete milestones may scale up or down depending on the validity of this estimated end date.

## Effort Matrix

Task list pulled from previous assignment, [which can be found here](project_planning/Tasklist.md). As a solo project, all tasks will have the same effort level per member.

| Task                                                                                                     | Effort Level (%) | Assigned To   |
