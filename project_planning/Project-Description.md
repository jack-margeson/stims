## Project Topic Area

The main area of focus for this project is creating and manipulating inventory databases to enable easy storage and retrieval of physical items through the implementation of a custom tagging system. 

The project will consist of a backend built in an object oriented langauge to utilize the power of inheritance to create different item structures. A GUI will also be built to facilitate ease of use by end-users when performing database actions.
